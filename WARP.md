# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal test repository (`testRepo2`) that currently contains:
- Basic markdown documentation files
- Three empty directories (`gitone`, `gittwo`, `gitthree`) that appear to be placeholders for future development
- A GitHub remote at `https://github.com/hvmz-v/testRepo2.git`

## Current Structure

The repository has a very simple structure with no active codebase or development toolchain yet established.

## Common Git Commands

Since this is primarily a Git repository, the most relevant commands are:

### Repository Management
```powershell
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Check remote repositories
git remote -v

# View all branches
git branch -a
```

### Basic Development Workflow
```powershell
# Add changes to staging
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

## Development Setup

This repository appears to be in early stages. When adding code:

1. **Choose your technology stack** - The empty directories suggest this might be intended for multi-component development
2. **Add appropriate build tools** - Consider adding package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, or other build configuration files based on your chosen technology
3. **Establish development workflow** - Add appropriate scripts for building, testing, and linting based on your technology choice
4. **Update this WARP.md** - Add specific build commands, architecture details, and development practices once the codebase grows

## Future Considerations

As this repository develops, consider adding:
- Build and dependency management configuration files
- Testing framework setup
- Continuous integration configuration
- Code formatting and linting tools
- More detailed architecture documentation in this file
